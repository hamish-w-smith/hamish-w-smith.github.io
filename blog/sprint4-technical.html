          <h3>Non-tech friend asks how you problem solve...</h3>

          <p>
            Even simple problems can sometimes get you stuck. This is often because you are overlooking some small detail or there is a small gap in your knowledge that you need to plug. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, referncing different pieces of data stored in an object (kind of like a draw in a filing cabinet) can be confusing. And it is easy to speed over details to get the references to this correct. What I have found helps is slowing down, (trying to) not getting frustrated and writing things out diagramatically. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After this you can piece things together in the script, and experiment, and read the background material. Don't get frustated, don't feel like asking help is weak and stick to the problem solving process. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Solving a problem in an elegant way is always a goal, but I think it is important for it not to be the goal, especially when you are using some tools, or solving an unfamiliar problem. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Elegant solutions most of the time are something that comes with practice, and progammers often only get to this stage, through something called refactoring. Sometimes you may have a bolt of inspiration, but usually it isn't worth waiting for it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A solution might be improved by removing of simplifying a code loop, or rewriting a piece of logic so it is easier to follow. Though sometimes, a shorter piece of code, might be harder to follow for others, than a slightly more long winded and less efficient example.

          <h3>The problem solving technique and process</h3>
          <time datetime="2019-05-10T17:00">10 May 2019</time>
          <p>
            Throughout foundations, a number of problem solving techniques have been reccomended. I like to think of them in broad categories as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 1- Thinking and explaining the problem and sketching things out which I do with pen and paper:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Step 2 -Researching the problem:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Googling</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Step 3 - Testing or trial and error:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trying something</li>              
            <li>Reading error messages</li>
            <li>Console.logging</li>           
          </ul>
          <p>
            And once again: improving the process with reflection.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use all of the tools in this list, and this is how I group them, and proceed through them, though the approach is iterative. First I use the rubber ducky method, which is mostly just explaining the problem in my own words. This flows to writing a first cut of pseudocode, reflecting on it, re-writing it, and working out what I want to research.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then go through a research stage, googling, talking with peirs and coaches (once I have formulated good questions - mostly I'll go to the testing step before this).
          </p>
          <p>
            Then to see if research is heading in the right direction, some trial and error is needed. Trying something, using console.log to see what the code outputs, using the debugger, and reading error messages is all part of this. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Then it is time to flow through the process again, after a break if concentration is fading. Don't forget to reflect, and use mediation to calm the mind if needed.
