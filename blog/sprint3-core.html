            <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
            <p><i>"The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions” Salovey and Mayer 1990”</i></p>
            <p>I like Mayer’s definition. Breaking it down emotional intelligence, often contrasted against intelligence quotient, is an ability or skill to applied to human expression and interaction. </p>

            <p>Different people have different abilities in this regard depending on their personality type, culture, upbringing, training, habits, and experiences. </p>
              
            <p>The consensus I found in my research is that it is certainly something that can be worked on and improved over time. </p>
              
            <p>The foundations material states that there are three steps of Emotional Intelligence, I think more properly stated as three main areas that one can focus on to improve emotional intelligence. 
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Attention training - (ability to focus deeply on a specific task of person without distraction and bias)</li>
                <li>Self knowledge and Mastery - (ability to acknowledge your emotions and state of mind, and address these)</li>
                <li>Creating Useful Mental Habits - (adoption, and adaptation of positive habits that help with 1. and 2. and  aid in mental focus and health. </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>How is Emotional Intelligence different to IQ?</h3>
              <p>
                Intelligence quotient or IQ has broadly been described as one's ability to rationalise and solve abstract problems. This is often tested by getting people to solve geometric problems such as mentally transforming shapes, or certain mathematical and pattern recognition problems. IQ focuses more on the abstract rather than the personal/interpersonal realm.

            <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence important?
            </h3>
            <p>It is important because fundamentally we all work in the human world and we are humans which have emotions, and interactions with each other. Very few people work solely on their own, and generally everyone can be much more effective and happier if we can address emotional intelligence issues. 
            </p>
          
            <p>Career wise, in any technical role, there will always be a requirement to communicate complex topics to other people whether they are technically trained or not, and this is a key factor in success for most people.
