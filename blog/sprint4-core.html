            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that the human mind and brain are continually developing in relation to experiences over time. Understanding that is is possible to actively work towards rewiring your mind and allowing it to become better at certain skills can be of benefit, because it provides motivation due to the fact that if you work in the right way you can become better at something, and a natural born gift isn’t everything - in fact for most people it is much less important than experience and attitude. </p>
            <p>A lot of the material on the internet relates to children's brains as many researchers used to think that the development of the brain ceased after adolescence, but in the last decade or so, there is much published evidence to suggest that the brain can be developed in adulthood too. 
            </p>
            <p>A couple of observations that are useful for learning, is that visualisation exercises, where you imagine undertaking a task, help build neural connections, and can help you learn a task faster when you actually come to do it. This means the planning and mapping tasks out, which has a component of visualisation, and also explaining how a task might be done to others, reinforcing and accelerates learning. </p>
            <p>Beyond the links provided in the Ensprial Dev Academy material, here are a couple of links in a New Zealand context. A teaser for a Nigel Latta documentary on the topic, and an interview on the topic on RNZ. </p>
              
            <p>The foundations material states that there are three steps of Emotional Intelligence, I think more properly stated as three main areas that one can focus on to improve emotional intelligence. 
              </p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/entertainment/watch-nigel-latta-curing-fear-in-matter-minutes-harnessing-power-your-brain">Nigel Latta documentary </a>includes an example of a women who had a condition where she suffered a stroke and frequent seizures, was able to rewire her brain to the extent that the half that was causing the seizures was able to be removed, and she was able to still get by quite well, incredible...</p>
              <p>This<a href="https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/201808236/neuroplasticity-and-healing-childrens'-brains"> RNZ interview</a> also has a facinating discussion on the topic.

              <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
              <p>The growth mindset is an idea closely bound to neuroplasticity, about attitudes to approaching new challenges. The growth mindset is contrasted against the fixed mindset where we think that due to a fixed ability or born talent threshold, we can’t improve a skill or knowledge set. 
              </p>
              <p>An individual’s opinion of their intelligence and ability, has a direct relationship to their ability to learn and undertake new challenges. And thus having a mindset where we say, I don’t understand this yet, but this is how I plan to succeed is actually a way of learning faster. 
              </p>
              <p>A revelation I had was that some of the encouragement I had gotten growing up (and have given to others) may not be an optimum way of giving feedback. To be honest, I am someone who still responds to feedback quite emotionally (though I tend to hide this) in adulthood, so it is still relevant to me too. </p>
              <p>Because of my child like (let’s say youthful) attitude to praise and visualisation, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLeUvZvuvAs">Janelle Morae</a> (and I like her a lot too) take on it on Sesame Street.</p>

            <h3>Integrating these concepts into my learning plan
            </h3>
            <p>Integrating this attitude along with neuroplasticity, and some meditation and visualisation training that I will commit to undertake routinely to build a habit will be incorporated into my <a href="sprint2-core.html">learning plan. </a>
