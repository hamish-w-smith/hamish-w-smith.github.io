          <h3>Overview of Core Learnings</h3>
          <p>
            Over the course of foundations I have had 2 really difficult weeks and one great week, in terms of learning and productivity. I have a long way to go in terms of dealing with my ego and self-doubt. Though there have been a few things that have helped.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking after your emotional and physical state with the help of meditation and exercise is critical to productivity, especially long term. If physical health, and emotional health are impacted there will be a proportional impact on performance in both personal and work life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking time to plan learning sessions is also critical, in order to get the most out of them. Reviewing learning outcomes, and looking for ways to circumvent road blocks in understanding helps producitivity. Using fellow students to discuss ideas helps too. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is difficult to stay in the growth mindset when it seems many of ones peers are rushing ahead in the course material. However to stay true to the process, one needs to focus on their own learning journey, and remember that learning is a combination of time, and deliberate practice. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The part that has probably suprised me the most has been utilising the Headspace website for guided mediation. This has been the first time I have really enjoyed it, and it has been more useful and less <em>mystical</em> which has frustrated me in the past. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The most challenging aspects of the core curriculum, particuarly during foundations, is that I found it difficult to learn some topics without direct guidance from the facilitators. It would have been helpful to have more regular catch-ups to discuss technical issues. 
          </p>
          <h3>Dev Academy's focus on core learning and human skills</h3>
          <p>A question asked is why EDA spends so much time focusing on human skills and learning skills instead of technical curriculum. I knew this was a feature of the school before I came so it was no surprise. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is the school does have a large technical curriculum, and having the right metal preparation and attitude helps to get the most out of it. It also helps set the student up to continue learning after they graduate. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During foundations, I actually think it might benefit if there were more core skills activity mixed in the technical content. This might provide a helpful break up of the material, and also help with frustration.
