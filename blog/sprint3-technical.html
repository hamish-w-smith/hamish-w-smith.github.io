            <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
            <time datetime="2019-05-5T17:00">05 May 2019</time>
            
            <p>HTML is the markup language of the internet. It is the builder, planner or bricklayer. It gives pages content and structure. CSS is the internets artist or designer, it gives pages polish, style, direction and soul. </p>

              <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
              <time datetime="2019-05-05T17:00">05 May 2019</time>
              <p>Control flow is the logical order in which a computer steps through statements in a script. </p>
              <p>An analogy could be a river. Water always flows downstream through the river, through a series of bends, and cascades. </p>
              <p>At dam might be like a conditional statement, if the flow is low, the river might be held back, if the flow is high, the dam's spillway might open. </p>
              <p>Further downstream might be some old ox-bows, that form an eddy or loop. The water will circulate round until released from loop and it continues to flow downstream. </p>

            <h3>Functions - why are they useful</h3>
            <time datetime="2019-05-05T19:00">05 May 2019</time>
            
            <p>Functions are abosolutely brilliant. Function is a stored set of instructions, that can be called at any time in a script, with a specified input. </p>
            <p>This means that once the instructions are typed once, they can be used again and again, and this is at the heart of automation, the most powerful part of copmuting. Computor are absolutely amazing at executing repeatative tasks. </p>

            <h3>The Document Object Model (DOM) and Developer Tools (DevTools)</h3>
            <time datetime="2019-05-05T13:00">05 May 2019</time>
            
            <p>The document object model the tree of items and linkages that the browser see's when it is commanded to access a site. The browser methodically processes all of the HTML elements and their children, applies styles, runs scripts, a ultimately displays a web pages (if instructed to do so, it could just run some script and display nothing). </p>
            <p>The DOM can be displayed from Developer Tools by right clicking and inspecting any element of a web page. It can also be accessed by writing the window. command into the browser's console. 
            </p>
            <p>Developer tools are there for the purpose of seeing under the hood of a webpage, and displaying how things are put together, helping to debug scripts, and many other things. </p>
            <p>By editing the elements in the DOM, how a webpage is displayed can be changed, like in the example below. </p>

              <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects.</h3>
              <time datetime="2019-05-05T13:00">05 May 2019</time>
              
              <p>Arrays are a data type where pieces of data are stored in a list. In javascript, data in arrays must be accessed by telling javascript what position the piece of data in the array is in (and counting starts at 0!). </p>
              <p>
                An object is a bucket that can store grouped functions (called methods), and data that has properties. In javascript methods, and properties are accessed in objects using the dot notation. 
              </p>
