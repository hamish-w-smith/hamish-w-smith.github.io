                        <p>I want to use the skills I and knowledge I learn into my existing career. I want to continually build on my software development skill set and find a new niche.

                <h3>Commitment to the EDA Programme</h3>
                
                <p>
                My basic commitment will be to get sprint work done by COB Friday. I am fortunate to be in a position where I can put a lot of time into the course including weekend, though I will respect other team mates boundaries with their personal commitments, and encourage them to be realistic about these. I will make a concerted effort to not leaving my facilitators or team mates hanging. 
                </p>
                <p>I will seek help by keeping to my check-in and meeting times, and communicating apologies when I cannot attend. </p>
                <p>I have made a commitment to devoting a significant amount of time to study. I will need to commit to looking after my personal fitness and well-being and attend my sports teams games when this does not interfere with study.</p>
                <p>
                Over foundations I have also committed to attending to some minor pieces of work, and during boot camp I will also make myself available to answer urgent work calls during specific hours. 
                </p>
                <p>I expect myself to be direct and honest with how my study is going, and I expect honest feedback. If team members are having significant issues or causing major disharmony I expect the facilitation team to intervene in a sensitive and timely manner, if required. </p>

            <h3>Impact of strengths and limitations on study</h3>
            
            <p>Strengths:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My work and technical and engineering background gives me a experience in problem solving. </li>
                <li>I am good at resolving conflicts and building consensus, allowing me to play a part in building team confidence. </li>
                <li>I am sensitive to peopleâ€™s points of view and have a thirst for knowledge.</li>
                <p>Weaknesses</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>My introversion means I often do not speak out in large large groups, and I need to make effort to open up and communicate.</li>
                    <li>I can be indecisive and this can mean I can take longer to finish things off, which means I need to focus on objectives, and keep a problem solving framework at the foremost. </li>
                    <li>In terms of learning, my personality type has a tendency to drift and read broadly rather than stay focused. Time boxing and deliberate learning goals will certainly help me succeed if I can be disciplined in sticking to them. </li>
                    <li>Self-doubt is common with my personality type in the face of setbacks which I have experienced at multiple times in the last few years. I need to open up about this to coaches and mentors. </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
