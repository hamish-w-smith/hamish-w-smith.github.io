      <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan Update</h3>
      <strong>Long term goals</strong>
      <p>
        My long term goal and career pathways have not changed from what I proposed during foundations. 
      </p>
      <strong>Strengths and Weaknesses</strong>
      <p>
        I have gotten very frustrated with trying to modify the code and kluge together imperfect solutions in order to practice rather than take an easier path. This is OK (apart from the getting frustrated) and I need to keep the learning competencies in mind when I am practicing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been able to concentrate for long periods of time but I need to be more deliberate and planned in my approach to maximise productivity. 
      </p>
      <strong>Non-technical challenges ahead at Bootcamp</strong>
      <p>
        My biggest challenges will be maintaining a positive state of mind if I feel like I am falling behind. I am confident I can put in the hours and keep the morale of those around me up. 
      </p>
      <strong>Non-technical skills to develop at BootCamp</strong>
      <p>
        Firstly I want to maximise my productivity with learning new skills at Dev Academy, and this may require some unlearning and relearning to create some better habits. I will have to take care to plan my scheule out to make the most of the precious time that is available, and manage my emotional and physical states.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also keen to work on my communication skills in terms of explaining techincal topics (which is also a good way of reinforcing learning) and my presentation skills, as these are key ingredients for success in any technical occupation. 
      </p>
      <strong>Expections of the Bootcamp Team</strong>
      <p>
        My expectations of the Bootcamp team is to give everyone a fair quantum of patience and time. To not play favourites, and not make assumptions about any person's abilities. 
      </p>
      <strong>Expectations of myself to the Bootcamp Team</strong>
      <p>
        At all times I will expect myself to ask good and well though out questions of the bootcamp team and take their advice on boards.

      <h3>Update following research on concepts of Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Following my review of the concepts of growth mindset and neuroplasticity, I want to try a meditation exercise before undertaking each challenge in my sprint 4 Kata. This will involve a brief mind clearing followed my some visualisation after I read the the challenge.

      <h3>Long term goals</h3>
      <p>
        I want to use the skills I and knowledge I learn into my existing career. I want to continually build on my software development skill set and find a new niche. 
      </p>
      <h3>Commitment to the EDA Programme</h3>
      <p>
        My intent will be to get core learning competencies completed each week by COB Friday. To enable this I will spend some time before each task planning, and constantly review. I am fortunate to be in a position where I can put a lot of time into the course including weekend, though I will respect other team mates boundaries with their personal commitments, and encourage them to be realistic about these. I will make a concerted effort to not leaving my facilitators or team mates hanging. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I will seek help by keeping to my check-in and meeting times, and communicating apologies when I cannot attend. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have made a commitment to devoting a significant amount of time to study. I will need to commit to looking after my personal fitness and well-being during the course as this will impact my productivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Over foundations I have also committed to attending to some minor pieces of work, and during boot camp I will also make myself available to answer urgent work calls during specific hours. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect myself to be direct and honest with how my study is going, and I expect honest feedback. If team members are having significant issues or causing major disharmony I expect the facilitation team to intervene in a sensitive and timely manner, if required. 
      </p>
      <h3>Impact of strengths and limitations on study</h3>
      <p>Strengths:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>My work and technical and engineering background gives me a experience in problem solving. </li>
          <li>I am good at resolving conflicts and building consensus, allowing me to play a part in building team confidence. </li>
          <li>I am sensitive to peopleâ€™s points of view and have a thirst for knowledge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weaknesses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My introversion means I often do not speak out in large large groups, and I need to make effort to open up and communicate.</li>
        <li>I can be indecisive and this can mean I can take longer to finish things off, which means I need to focus on objectives, and keep a problem solving framework at the foremost. </li>
        <li>In terms of learning, my personality type has a tendency to drift and read broadly rather than stay focused. Time boxing and deliberate learning goals will certainly help me succeed if I can be disciplined in sticking to them. </li>
        <li>Self-doubt is common with my personality type in the face of setbacks which I have experienced at multiple times in the last few years. I need to open up about this to coaches and mentors. </li>
      </ul>
